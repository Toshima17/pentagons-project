# pentagons-project- MENTAL CHECK-IN JOURNAL
Mental Check-In Journal Bot is a user-friendly chatbot designed to encourage self-reflection and emotional awareness. It initiates mood-check conversations and records user responses in a personal mood journal, helping individuals track their emotional well-being over time.

Built during a 3-day inter-community hackathon, this project aims to make mental health support more accessible through simple yet meaningful daily interactions. Whether you're seeking a tool for self-awareness or a base to build advanced mental wellness features, this chatbot offers a thoughtful starting point.
